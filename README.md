# PyMuPDF4LLM

PyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized extension of PyMuPDF designed specifically for extracting content from PDFs in a format that's optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Key Features

1. Markdown Output

- Converts PDFs to clean, structured Markdown format
- Preserves document hierarchy (headers, lists, tables)
- Makes PDF content easily digestible for LLMs like Claude, GPT, etc.

2. Intelligent Structure Detection

- Automatically identifies headers, paragraphs, tables, and images
- Maintains document layout and reading order
- Preserves semantic structure

3. Image Handling

- Extracts images from PDFs
- Can save images separately or encode them inline
- Useful for multimodal LLMs that can process images

## Installation

The Python package on PyPI [pymupdf4llm](https://pypi.org/project/pymupdf4llm/) (there also is an alias [pdf4llm](https://pypi.org/project/pdf4llm/)) is capable of converting PDF pages into **_text strings in Markdown format_** (GitHub compatible). This includes **standard text** as well as **table-based text** in a consistent and integrated view - a feature particularly important in RAG settings.

```bash
$ pip install -U pymupdf4llm
```

> This command will automatically install [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) if required.

Then in your script do

```python
import pymupdf4llm

md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("input.pdf")

# now work with the markdown text, e.g. store as a UTF8-encoded file
import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())
```

Instead of the filename string as above, one can also provide a PyMuPDF `Document`. By default, all pages in the PDF will be processed. If desired, the parameter `pages=[...]` can be used to provide a list of zero-based page numbers to consider.

Markdown text creation now also processes **multi-column pages**.

To create small **chunks of text** - as opposed to generating one large string for the whole document - the new (v0.0.2) option `page_chunks=True` can be used. The result of `.to_markdown("input.pdf", page_chunks=True)` will be a list of Python dictionaries, one for each page.

Also new in version 0.0.2 is the optional **extraction of images** and vector graphics: use of parameter `write_images=True`. The will store PNG images in the document's folder, and the Markdown text will appropriately refer to them. The images are named like `"input.pdf-page_number-index.png"`.

## Document Support

While PDF is by far the most important document format worldwide, it is worthwhile mentioning that all examples and helper scripts work in the same way and **_without change_** for [all supported file types](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-open-a-file.html#supported-file-types).

So for an XPS document or an eBook, simply provide the filename for instance as `"input.mobi"` and everything else will work as before.
